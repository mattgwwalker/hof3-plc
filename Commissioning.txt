HOF3 Commissioning
==================

Connect to the network with SSID 'PWCL_HOF3'.  The router has IP
address 192.168.1.1.  The PLC has IP address 192.168.1.91.

Run the batch file setroot.bat, this will produce HOF3.bas.  There is
a separate readme file that discusses setroot.bat.

Use the Texmate Development System (specifically version 3.8.9.23
with the version of the compiler provided with this repository).
compile HOF3.bas and open the port to the PLC.


Communication with the PLC:
---------------------------

To test communication with the PLC, read the register CPU_LOADING.
(It was 61--62% as at 2017-12-13.)

To command the PLC, Write to register 6010 (fd100cmd).  The values for
each command can be found in FD/100/_USER_MEMORY.bas:

CONST fd100cmd_NONE  = 0 // No Action
CONST fd100cmd_ACK   = 1 // Acknowledge End State
CONST fd100cmd_AWAIT_PUSH_BUTTON = 2 // Pushbutton Required
CONST fd100cmd_STOP  = 3 // Stop
CONST fd100cmd_RUN   = 4 // Mixing, recirculating, concentrating, and then concentrating to empty
CONST fd100cmd_PAUSE = 5 // Pause ... i.e. simulate PB01 action
CONST fd100cmd_ABORT = 6 // Abort current sequence
CONST fd100cmd_WASTE = 7 // Send feed tank to waste
CONST fd100cmd_STORE = 8 // Send feed tank to storage tank
CONST fd100cmd_STORE_TO_WASTE = 9 // Storage tank to waste

When the PLC displays "Ready" on the LCD screen, it is waiting for a
command.  For example, to send the feedtank to waste, set fd100cmd to
the value 7.  The PLC will then display "Waiting" on the LCD screen to
indicate that it has finished the command and is waiting for
acknowledgement.  To acknowledge the end state, send the value 1 to
fd100cmd.


To confirm communication:
-------------------------
{FIX ME; this isn't valid for HOF3}
- add User/UserVariables/TT01 to the watch window
 - turn the watch on
 - check that the value for TT01 from the PLC matches the value on the
   LED screen.


To modify the state of a valve:
-------------------------------
 - ensure that the plant is in the stopped state (fd100StepNumber == 0)
 - the cmd variable (for example, IV15cmd) sets the valve to one of three
   states:
     0 -> None (This causes no change in state.)
     1 -> Auto Mode
     2 -> Manual Mode
     2 -> Manual Off
     3 -> Manual On
 - add the cmd variable to the watch window (find the variable under
   User/UserVariables)
 - turn the watch on
 - double click on the variable in the watch window
 - type the new value and press enter
 
Note that many of the valves require air pressure to function, and {is
this turn of HOF3?} the system DOES NOT check that there is
sufficient, or even any, air pressure.  Further, note that the valve
may already be in the desired state.  To check that it is working
change the state from manul mode, to manual off to manual on and then
to auto mode.  If everything is working correctly, this should change
the valve position and then return it back again to its original
position.

Pumps:
------

Warning: PP01 should only be run when the seal water is running
(as isolated by IV15 and as detected by FS01).

To run a pump, there is both a run signal and a run speed.  The signal
variable ends in 'cmd' (for example, 'PP01cmd').

For PP01, the run speed is stored in the variable PP01_RawSpeed.  This
is the variable that is converted to the 4--20mA signal.  This
variable is primarily controlled by the PID controller PC01:
PP01_RawSpeed is set to PC01cv inside the file PP01.bas.  PC01's
process variable is PT01--the pressure after the pumped liquid has
gone through the bag filter.  PC01's setpoint is controlled by the
variable PC01spRampTarget, which is directly proportional to DPC01cv,
another PID controller's output.  DPC01 controls the differential
pressure along the membrane.

Thus to control the speed of PP01, there are three options: either
place PC01 in set output mode, or control DPC01 via set output mode,
or control DPC01 by modifying its setpoint.

To control the speed of PP01 by placing PC01 in "set output" mode:
  1. Write the value 2 into PC01cmd to place it into "Manual" mode.
  2. Write the value 3 into PC01cmd to place it into "Set Output" mode.
  3. Write the desired pump speed (from 0 to 10,000, corresponding to
     0% to 100%) into PC01cv, say 1000 for a speed of 10%.
  4. Write the value 2 into PP01cmd to place the pump into "Manual".
  5. Write the value 4 into PP01cmd to place the pump into "Run".
  6. Write the value 3 into PP01cmd to place the pump into "Stop".
  7. Write the value 1 into PP01cmd to place the pump into "Auto".
  8. Write the value 1 into PC01cmd to place it into "Auto".






The speed variable is a percentage multiplied by 100.  So to set the
speed to 50%, set the variable to 50x100 = 5000.  The VSDs will ramp
the pump speed slowly to ensure that the pumps are not shoked by a
request to go from say 0% to 100%, or visa versa.

For pump 1, the VSD ensure a safe minimum run speed for the pump, thus
setting the speed to 0% does not stop the pump, but rather runs it as
slowly as possible in a manner that can be maintained without over
heating the pumps.  This is not the case for pump 2.

To run and to stop the pump, use the command variable.  Set the
command variable to one of three states:
     0 -> None (This causes no change in state.)
     1 -> Auto
     2 -> Manual Off
     3 -> Manual On

Make sure there is liquid in the tank before starting the pump as the
pumps do not appreciate being run dry.

Commissioning notes:
--------------------

2018-01-14:

Draining via web-interface is now working.

When the feedtank is empty, LT01 is measuring over the original 3%
threshold.  Changed threshold for reliable measurement to 4% (from
3%).

Tested filling with water, mixing, and heating during mixing using the
production page.

Tested push button to pause and unpause plant during mixing.

Tested cooling using both CP01 and CP02.

Tested along-membrane pressure control (DPC01).


2018-01-12:

The air supply to IV01 came off under pressure.  Reduced air pressure
to 6 bar (from ~8 bar).  

Used PT01 to recalibrate channel 5 (PT01) and channel 7 (LT01).

Used PH01 to recalibrate channel 9 (PH01).


2018-01-07:

PP01 runs.  Instructions added to this commissioning document to get
pump to run manually.

DV02 is leaking air when in state 4.  Manually forcing it to state 3
stops the leaking.


2017-12:

The valves have been made to change state and all but a couple seem to
be working fine.  Two air fittings had to be replaced as they were no
longer reliably gripping their air hoses and under pressure the hoses
would pop off.

The analgue inputs are working again after a correction to the code
regarding the SMART modules.  It appears that the SMART module for the
analogue input module ISQP1 had been moved from the second the the
third SMART port.

The pump PP01 does not seem to be starting.


2017-11:

The controller was sent back to Define Instruments as Roy suspected a
hardware fault when the controller once again started to error on
boot.  This repair did not seem to resolve the issue as the errors
continued to appear.  However, they have since stopped appearing.


2017-11-09:

Plant left off overnight only for the controller to display a range of
error messages on boot in the morning.  "46 Err E", "43 Err E", "18
Err E", and "6 Err E" were displayed.  See pages 201--205 of
ICC402-REG-MAN for an explanation of the different errors.

Talked to Roy from Define Instruments.  He recommended reinitialising
the controller using the TDS (Erase Macro > Re-initialise) and reading
and then writing EPROM values.  This included:
* SmartModule/1/Setup/SMART_SETUP1 to clear error #43.
* Serial/Port1/STRING_CHARACTER1 to clear error #46.

It was also necessary to re-download the code into the controller.

This resulted in a controller that once again started, however the
analogue configuration will need to be re-done.


2017-11-08:

Rig first turned on since 2013.  No obvious problems.
